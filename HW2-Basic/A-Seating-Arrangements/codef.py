Algorithm Explanation:

A person is only happy when they sit next to a family member  in a pair or singles in a row.
We go through over all possible numbers of family pairs (x) that can be seated in r rows.
For each x, we check the leftover people and remaining rows.
Then check how many singles can be seated alone rather than sitting with a different family which breaks the rule.
The result is the maximum total number of happy people on all possibilities and combinations.

Time Complexity:
For each test case, we loop up to O(r) (maximum rows), which is at most 500.
Preprocessing steps like summing array elements take O(n), where n â‰¤ 100.

Complexity per test case is O(n)
So the overall time complexity per test case is O(r), and for t test cases, it's O(t * r).
