Penny: What is this?

Sheldon: It's a questionnaire I devised. I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me. ... It shouldn't take you more than three hours.

......

Penny: Wait! How many questions are on this thing?

Sheldon: Only 211. Don't worry, in deference to you, I've kept them on a high school graduate reading level.

Penny: Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don't know, pleasant?

Sheldon: Well that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your (pointing to the next page) essay.

(Later)

Raj: I'm curious. In the "How Well Do You Know Sheldon" section, what do you put for his favorite amino acid?

Leonard and Howard: Lysine.

Raj: Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;‚Äì *The Big Bang Theory, S2E13*

In S2E13, Sheldon created a "friendship questionnaire" to survey "why his current friends like him". Most of these questions are multiple-choice questions (but it also contains an essay).

Sheldon was very unhappy with Raj's answers to the multiple-choice questions - Raj answered many of them wrong. For example, Raj didn't know his favorite amino acid! Raj explained "I must have made some mistakes when I copied out the answers. My answers should still be mostly correct!"

To make Sheldon believe him, Raj wanted to figure out how "far" his answers were from Sheldon's standard answers. The mistakes he may have made include:

1. accidentally copy a letter to be another  
2. accidentally omit a letter in the answer  
3. accidentally added a letter somewhere in the answer

He wanted to persuade Sheldon that he only made a few small mistakes. As long as he fixed all of them, he will get the perfect answer. Given Raj's answers and Sheldon's standard answers, your task is to find the smallest number of mistakes Raj has made to come up with his current answers. This number must be as small as possible - the smaller it is, the more likely they were just "mistakes" instead of Raj answering them arbitrarily.

In fact, Raj's answer is indeed close, so you can assume the number of mistakes is always within 100.



### Input

The first line contains an integer ùëõ, which is the number of multiple-choice problems.  
The second line contains ùëõ characters, which are Sheldon's standard answers to the ùëõ problems.  
The third line contains ùëõ characters, which are Raj's answers to the problems.  

All answers are uppercase letters from "A" to "D".



### Output

The output is only one integer, which is the smallest number of mistakes that Raj had made to turn his answer from totally correct to his current answers.

### Note

For 40% of the test cases, ùëõ‚â§1000.  
For 100% of the test cases, ùëõ‚â§100000, the answer is within 100.  

For sample input/output 2, Raj may have only made two mistakes: he may have accidentally omitted the first "A", and added a "C" at the end.
